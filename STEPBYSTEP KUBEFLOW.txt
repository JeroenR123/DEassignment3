1. Create a cluster in google cloud
kubernetes Engine > Cluster > (4nodes should be enough) - (you can create it here or create it directly with the Kubeflow Pipeline later) 
2.Create Kubeflow Pipelines
AI Platform > Pipelines > New instance > Configure > 
	U must:
	Select an existing cluster or create cluster (as u wish)
	Allow access to the following cloud APIs 

-Once it is created "OPEN PIPELINES DASHBOARD" - copy the URL
3.Create Notebooks
AI Platform > Notebooks > New instance  (Python 3)
	OPEN JUPYTERLAB
	in the Terminal or in a new notebook: pip install -r mlops-stock-prediction/requirements.txt (U can drop this notebook later)
	I cloned Ekhtiar repository: https://github.com/ekhtiar/mlops-stock-prediction.git
mlops-.. > Notebooks
	I drop his Notebooks and upload Sietske Notebooks and "raw_data2.csv" there
	Then open the notebook and ... KFP weather.ipynb > KFP_HOST_NAME: (erase the 'http:xyz...' and paste the kubeflow URL )
	Run all

5.To observe the pipelines:
AI Platform > Pipelines > Experiments  > Default
